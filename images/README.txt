Place candidate portrait images here.
Expected filenames currently in code:
 - trump_portrait.jpg  (2025 official portrait)
 - harris_headshot.jpg (optional)
 - fallback_portrait.jpg (used automatically if primary image fails)

After copying images, Vite dev server will serve them at /images/<name>.  No rebuild needed for dev.
